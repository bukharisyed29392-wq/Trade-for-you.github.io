        <h2>What is Stock Trading?</h2>
        <p>Stock trading involves buying and selling shares of companies on the stock market. Stocks represent ownership in a company, and their value can rise or fall based on the company's performance and market conditions.</p>

        <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stocks</strong>: Shares of ownership in a company. Buying stocks means you own a piece of that company.</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Market</strong>: A marketplace (like NYSE or NASDAQ) where stocks are traded.</li>
            <li><strong>Investing vs. Trading</strong>: Investing is long-term (holding stocks for years), while trading is short-term (buying/selling frequently to profit from price changes).</li>
            <li><strong>Risk</strong>: Stocks can lose value, so diversification (spreading investments) is key.</li>
        </ul>
